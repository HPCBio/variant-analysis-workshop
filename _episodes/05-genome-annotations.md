title: "Working with genome annotations"
teaching: 30
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What genes are near my SNPs of interest?"
objectives:
- "Build search windows, sized based on LD in your population, flanking SNPs of interest."
- "Identify genes within your search windows."
- "Determine functional consequences of SNPs."
keypoints:
- "Genome annotations can either be stored as GRanges imported with rtracklayer, or as TxDb imported with GenomicFeatures."
- "Functions that find overlaps between GRanges objects can be used to identify genes near SNPs."
- "The predictCoding function in VariantAnnotation identified amino acid changes caused by SNPs."

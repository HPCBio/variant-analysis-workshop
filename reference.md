## Glossary

{:auto_ids}
Annotation
:   The locations of genes, transcripts, exons, and CDS in the genome, as well as some metadata about genes.

CDS
:   Coding sequence.  DNA sequence that can be directly translated to amino acid sequence.

FASTA
:   A common file format for DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequence.  Reference genome sequences are commonly stored as FASTA.

GFF
:   General Feature Format.  A type of file that lists the genome annotation.  GFF3 and GTF are types of GFF.

Reference genome
:   A genome sequence and annotation for a particular species.  Often, the reference is based on the genome of one individual.

SNP
:   Single nucleotide polymorphism.

VCF
:   Variant Call Format.  A flexible file format for storing the location of variants (SNPs and otherwise) in the genome, as well as genotypes of a set of samples for those variants.

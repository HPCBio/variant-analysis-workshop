## Lesson motivation and learning objectives

## Lesson design

My goal is to teach episodes 1 and 2 and get partway through episode 3
(reading VCFs) on the first two-hour day.

In episode 1, `DNAStringSets` are not super important for the rest of the
lesson, so cover those quickly.

The code from `snpStats` in episode 4 for getting linkage disequilibrium
vs. physical distance is hacky enough that I think it is better to just give
them the code and demonstrate it rather than do live coding.

In Dec. 2020, I ended up skipping episode 4.  There was more interest in episode
5, and I did not end up with enough time for both.

title: "Importing a VCF into Bioconductor"
teaching: 45
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How can I import and filter a VCF with Bioconductor?"
objectives:
- "Read genotypes and SNP metadata from a VCF into R."
- "Compress and index a VCF for quick access."
- "Use custom parameters to filter variants into a smaller file."
- "Choose which fields, samples, and genomic ranges to import into R."
keypoints:
- "Index the VCF file with indexTabix if you plan to only import certain ranges."
- "Use filterVcf to filter variants to a new file without importing data into R."
- "Use ScanVcfParam to specify which fields, samples, and genomic ranges you want to import."
